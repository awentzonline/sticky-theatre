sticky-theatre
==============
Virtually have a shitty experience at a movie theater.
Tested with Google Cardboard.

Customize your own venue
------------------------
Make your own shitty theater with your favorite software that exports
three.js JSON (I'm using Blender).

There must be a mesh named 'screen'. This is the screen. It should probably
be a plane but use your imagination.

There must also be another mesh named 'viewer'. The origin of this mesh shall
be the viewpoint from which you (un)enjoy the movie. This mesh will be
hidden by the code.
